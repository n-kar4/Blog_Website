ERF-1 PHX to ERF Transactions,Version Control,Field,"Description: Phoenix does not have the ability to distinguish what is/isn't an ERF fund, so only send rows where an ERF match is found. ERF-1 PHX to ERF is a daily transaction feed from Phoenix to ERF for ERF designated Funds Only.  Transactions include DB Expenses.  Feed should only contain Active Plans.  ERF is expecting Prudential legacy values (PRISM Contract Number, Investment Code, etc.). Phoenix will send 3 files (one at 1am, 4am, & 8am eastern). CaTs needs merge the files into one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary,,List,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"Note: ERF-5 was removed from scope.  Today PARIS sends a separate file to ERF with the DB Expenses for Active Contracts. Joe discussed this the other day with Ramesh and they agree that Post TSA Phoenix will send all transactions including DB Expenses in the 3am and 5am files of ERF-1. CaTS will not try to split the DB Expenses into a separate file, ERF was going to make a change to their scripting so they don't expect a separate file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
